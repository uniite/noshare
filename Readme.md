# noshare
Private photo storage and sharing, optimized for mobile browsers.

## Status
This project is still very experimental, as most of the effort was in creating an HTML5 UI that is as fast
as possible on mobile device browsers (mainly Safari on iOS, and Chrome on Android).

## Dependencies
This project runs on Ruby on Rails, but requires NodeJS/NPM to install bower, which is used for
managing the project's third-party Javascript libraries.
